To create this engine in Python, we would need the following data:

Data:
List of Countries, Capital Cities, and their location
Happiness Index of each country
Preferred types of venues	(User Input)
Relative importance for each venue type	(User Input)

Transformation:
Tables from pages to Pandas data frame
Coordinates to correct format for Foursquare query	
Top Venues per Location
Cleanup of Venue Categories
Matrix format containing count of each category

Sources
List of Countries, Capital Cities, Coordinates: https://lab.lmnixon.org/4th/worldcapitals.html
Happiness Index for each Country: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report
Top Venue Categories: Foursquare API


The happiness index of each country is where I will do initial testing and confirmation that the environment impacts happiness. 
The user inputs will be used to generate a 'score' for each place. This is ideally customizable depending on the clientâ€™s preferences.
